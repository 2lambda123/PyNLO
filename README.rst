pyNLO: Nonlinear optics modeling codes for Python.
=======================

Scientific codes for optical physics.



----

pyNLO is a package for modeling nonlinear optics, with a focus on fiber laser systems with repetition rates of tens to thousands of megahertz. Currently supported interactions are four-wave mixing in nonlinear fiber (nonlinear Schrodinger equation) and three-wave difference-frequency mixing in bulk crystals.
